<h3>SUMERU</h3>

<ins>1. & 2. "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"</ins>

This Commission can be received up to three times per Commission cycle and is divided into three parts.

Part 1 will always be the Initial Version. The type and quality of the dish do not affect the follow-up versions.

Part 2 can be one of the following versions: Total Loss, Small Profit, Bargain Hunting, Fortune
The Total Loss and Fortune versions end the Commission series here, forcing a restart from the Initial Version in the next Commission cycle.
The Small Profit and Bargain Hunting versions allow to player to continue to Part 3.

Part 3 can be one of the following versions: Total Loss, Fortune
Completing the follow-up Commission in which Hatim goes bargain-hunting grants the Wonders of the World achievement When Wealth Comes A-Knockin'.
Completing the follow-up Commission in which Hatim makes a fortune grants the Wonders of the World achievement Kalimi's Fungus.

In order to receive both achievements within the same cycle, the player needs to complete the Commission series in the following order:

Initial → Bargain Hunting → Fortune

<ins>3. "Meow... Meow meow? Meow! Meow."</ins>

The player is granted the Wonders of the World achievement Catch Me-ow if You Can! when all three cats have been caught successfully.

Since the achievement registers each cat when it is caught and not when the commission is completed by reporting back to Sareh, it is possible to receive the achievement within a single commission cycle by catching the cats and never reporting back to finish the commission.

Each cat has five possible locations which are randomly chosen upon starting the challenge. This location can change if the challenge is abandoned.
