<ins>3. "Meow... Meow meow? Meow! Meow."</ins>

https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Meow..._Meow_meow%3F_Meow!_Meow.

The player is granted the Wonders of the World achievement Catch Me-ow if You Can! when all three cats have been caught successfully.

Since the achievement registers each cat when it is caught and not when the commission is completed by reporting back to Sareh, it is possible to receive the achievement within a single commission cycle by catching the cats and never reporting back to finish the commission.

Each cat has five possible locations which are randomly chosen upon starting the challenge. This location can change if the challenge is abandoned.

- Lale found AND CORRECTLY DONE, not completed
- Nargis
- Rozan found AND CORRECTLY DONE
